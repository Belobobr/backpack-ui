# backpack-ui-styles [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci]

backpack-ui-styles contains the design tokens used across lonelyplanet.com. Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. They are to be used in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

The design tokens are organized as such:

##### colors
Includes color values for backgrounds, text, borders, shadows, links, ui and accents. It also includes social network branding colors.

##### fonts
Includes two primary font stacks; Benton Sans (sans-serif) and Miller Daily (serif); Benton Sans is set globally, so there is no need to set it at the component level. Miller Daily is generally used for accent text.

##### media queries
Includes both min- and max-width media queries. Used to define break points for components and pages.

##### timing
Used for animation durations.

##### typography
Includes font weights (for Benton Sans only), font sizes and line heights.

##### z-index
Used for layering elements on the z-axis.
